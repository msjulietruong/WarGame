# WarGame

  This repository shows my favorite card game called War that I replicated in C++. 
  
  In the game, the program asks for Player 1 and Player 2's names. Afterwards, it will ask the user how many games they would like to play. The program will run that many games if the number of games requested is lower than the amount of cards. In other words, the max amount of games is 26, given that there are 52 cards in a deck. Otherwise, it will throw an error, stating that there are no more cards left to play with. 
  
  Below is a demo of the card game! This screenshot shows what happens when the number of games is lower than the amount of cards. Player 1 (Mario) goes against Player 2 (Bowser) 10 times (the amount the player specifies).

  Here is another demo conveying what happens when the number of games requested is higher than the amount of cards. Player 1 (Mario) goes against Player 2 (Bowser) 2000 times.
