# WarGame
This repository shows my favorite card game called War that I replicated in C++. In the game, the program asks for Player 1 and Player 2's names. Afterwards, it will ask the user how many games they would like to play. The program will run that many games if the number of games requested is lower than the amount of cards. Otherwise, it will throw an error, stating that there are no more cards left to play with.
